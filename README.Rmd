# FDATSM

<!-- badges: start -->
The R package `FDATSM` enables quantitative analysis of covariations of difference returns as described in the articles [**Robust Functional Data Analysis for Stochastic Evolution Equations in Infinite Dimensions**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16286) by [Dennis Schroers](https://github.com/dschroers). The data inputs should be yield or discount data over over a prespecified time span (e.g. a quarter, a year, a decade) and an upper limit on the time to maturity (e.g. 5 years, 10 years, 30 years). The resolution of the data in time and time to maturity should coincide (e.g. if data are available daily, the corresponding yields or zero-coupon bond prices must be available in a daily resolution in the maturity dimension). For the important case of daily data, this necessitates smoothed discound or yield curves. In the example presented below, we use data from ... and ... .  
The estimated covariations of difference returns correspond to rescaled empirical covariances of difference returns and are provided in matrix format. A jump truncation method is also available, corresponding to an outlier robust estimator for the covariations.

## Installation

You can install the development version of FDATSM from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dschroers/FDASPDE")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(FDATSM)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
